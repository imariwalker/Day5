      <h2>Diversity Teaching Statement</h2>
      <p>
        At an early age, I discovered a desire for disseminating knowledge in a way
        that is relatable to my peers and younger age groups. Through their own passion,
        faculty mentors and teachers have inspired me to contribute to teaching others and
        furthering my research on plastic additives in the environment.
      </p>
      <h2>Passion for Teaching</h2>
      <p>
        From my experience as a tutor and a mentor for undergraduate students in
        STEM, it has provided me fulfillment in teaching others the joy of learning.
         My passion stems from the direct impact that I can have on the next generation of
         students studying science and engineering. Engaging with these students has shown me
         that many have the potential to go on to graduate studies and do important research
         in the field of stem.
      </p>
      <h2>Teaching Objectives</h2>
      <p>
        My goal in teaching is to encourage students to approach real world problems critically
         and creatively evaluate new solutions. I plan to push students to identify problems,
         use their background knowledge to formulate a hypothesis, and utilize new technology
         to come to a solution.
      </p>
      <h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
      <p>
        As a student, instructors have inspired my passion for science through their own enthusiasm,
        availability, approachability, and outgoingness. Therefore, as a professor, I aim to utilize
         these characteristics in my methods of teaching. This will be completed by having multiple
         scheduled office hours every week, having an open door policy, answering students emails promptly,
          and personally reaching out to students that are struggling in my class. This will encourage an
          atmosphere that is open and inviting for students that have different methods for learning and
          reaching out for help. I believe instituting anonymous 1 minute reflections once a week and
          doodle polls on the course content will also be important to get a feel for which subjects
          were not explained well for the class. I will also have technology like piazza that allows
          for students to anonymously post questions and answers for concepts that may need a different
          perspective to clarify. Two challenges that I will face in teaching is working with students
          that are less attentive and managing time to efficiently teach the important topics. To fix
          that I believe that having patience, creativity and great organization will be vital. To truly
           determine how my teaching has impacted student learning, final exams and projects will
           demonstrate the students ability to problem solve and communicating their steps to coming
            to conclusions. I believe that for the field of stem, it is important to put into practice
             the theory and concepts that are being taught by putting together interactive experiments,
              demonstrations, and videos.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a mentor for undergraduate students, my method of creating an open learning environment
        is by openly listening to their needs, their struggles, and their passions. As a Sensor
        Saturday Academy mentor for 8th grade students, I assist students in learning concepts
         of linear algebra, circuits, water quality, temperature. After each powerpoint lecture,
         I walk through the assigned worksheets with groups of 2-3 students to reinforce the concept.
         In the afternoons of the Sensor Academy, I assist the students through the 5 building blocks
         of engineering design. Each week they are designated a task to complete, a list of material
         they can use, and a time frame to complete it in. My job is to guide a small group’s school
         of thought into creating the most cost and time effective engineering solution. It is incredibly
          rewarding to see their joy of learning how to accomplish these task through trial and error.
          My teaching method in these groups is to encourage each person in the group to communicate
          their opinions and ideas on solving this problem to make the space inclusive and encourage
          team work. Each week, I also flip each person’s role in the group to allow each one learn
          how to take on a variety of leadership positions.
        </p>
        <h2>Ongoing Development</h2>
        <p>
          The upcoming year, I will have the opportunity to become a teaching assistant
          for environmental chemistry. This will allow me to further improve as an
          instructor and develop my teaching abilities for the future.
          I believe that mentoring is also an important part of becoming a better teacher.
          Understanding the background that students come from allows for the class to be better
          tailored for each group and allows for a greater diversity of thought.
          As a professor, I plan to continue to mentor underrepresented high school and
          undergraduate students through participating in underrepresented minority research experiences.
          I would also like to be a faculty advisor for the university chapter of national society of black engineers.
          My teaching experiences as a mentor for undergraduate students and as a peer tutor
          have encourage me to further my training in teaching in preparation of becoming a
          future faculty instructor. I am working to a certificate in college teaching at Duke University,
          to further improve my teaching skills and learn the latest instructional technology and methods
          for class design.
